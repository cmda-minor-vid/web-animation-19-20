## Lab

### Transitions in Space

> Add interactivity based on user input

#### Synopsis

*   **Time**: 16:00h
*   **Goals**: subgoal _5_, subgoal _6_, subgoal _7_ & subgoal _8_
*   **Due**: before _lecture 3_

#### Description
Your artwork should respond to input from the user. Use transitions, animation, pseudo-classes and events to make your artwork interactive.  What happens when people hover over certain elements with their mouse? What if they press keys on their keyboard?
* Can the user `:hover` over certain elements with their mouse?
* What happens when the user tries to use a keyboard?
* Should something happen when you scroll the page?
* Do you need JavaScript to listen for events?
